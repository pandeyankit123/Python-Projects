 Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. In this tutorial, I will teach you how you can make your personal A.I. assistant using Python. 

What can this A.I. assistant do for you?
It can send emails on your behalf.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
Enough talks! Let's start building our own J.A.R.V.I.S.
